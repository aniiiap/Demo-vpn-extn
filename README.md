# Edu VPN Switcher v2

Improved version with better styling and more reliable proxy source (Geonode). This is still educational/demo.

## Important notes
- To truly change Chrome's network proxy you must load the built extension (dist folder) in Chrome and grant proxy permission.
- Public proxies are unreliable; some will fail. The UI now provides clearer messages.

## Build & Load
1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. chrome://extensions -> Developer mode -> Load unpacked -> select 'dist' folder

## Submission
Fill in your details and include GitHub + demo link (UI only) or a short video showing extension loaded and Connect working.
